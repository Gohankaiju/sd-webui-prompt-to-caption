## Introduction
 - Extract prompt data from images in the image folder and create a caption text file.

 - LoRA information is automatically deleted and a text file is created with only the prompts as captions.

 - If metadata could not be obtained from the images, a caption file can be created by BLIP instead.

## How to Use

 - Enter the path of image folder and click the gen button.

 - If "Enable BLIP" is checked, BLIP caption will be created on images for which metadata could not be obtained. (If Enable BLIP is not checked, an empty text file will be created.)
